# Pong Game 
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game in Python using the PyGame library. The game features an advantaged bot with a faster paddle, arrow key functionality for user-controlled paddle movement, and minimal code.

## How to Play
The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. 

## Controls
The paddle is controlled using the "Up Arrow" key to move up and the "Down Arrow" key to move down. 

## Scoring
If the ball hits the opponent's paddle, the player scores one point. If the ball goes past the opponent's paddle, the player scores one point and the ball is reset to the center of the screen.

## Requirements
To run the game, you will need Python 3.x and the PyGame library installed on your system.

## Running the Game
To run the game, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the pong.py file. Then, run the following command:

Copy code
 ```
python pong.py
 ```
